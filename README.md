## Project Structure and Organization
We've reorganized the file structure to adhere to Maven's standards. This helps in maintaining a clean and organized repository. Here's how we've structured our directories:
- The main application code is located in `src/main/java/currencyConverter/`.
- The unit test files are in `src/test/java/currencyConverter/`.

## Running Tests
To execute the tests, follow these simple steps:
1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to the project's root directory.
3. Run the following command:
   ```sh
   mvn test
   ```
4. The test results will be displayed in the terminal. Additionally, they are saved in text files located at `target/surefire-reports/` for further analysis and record-keeping.
